  <h1>My HTML Notes</h1>

<p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>
<h2>The Web</h2>

<p>The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>
<h2>What is HTML?</h2>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.</p>

<ol>
    <li>cats</li>
    <li>dogs</li>
    <li>birds</li>
    <li>snakes</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>bananas</li>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>The browser tries to figure out the structure of the document based on a set of rules and assumptions it makes</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mammals
      <ol>
        <li>Raccoons
        <li>Gorillas
      </ol>
    <li>Reptiles
      <ol>
        <li>Iguanas
        <li>Cobras
      </ol>
    <li>Birds
      <ol>
        <li>Ostriches
        <li>Ravens
        <li>Tweety</li>
      </ol>
  </ul>

  <p>The grammar of HTML does not require that you literally write a <em>head</em> or <em>body</em> tag in your HTML code. Many web developers do write these. However, if you don't, the browser will attempt to place them into your code itself.</p>

  <p>It needs to put the head element around certain elements that belong there, such as title; and to put the body element around the elements that form the document's body. This means that all the head elements must appear first, and the body elements after.</p>
